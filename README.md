# Module 1 Javascript Assignment

There is a test suite to guide you and help you check yourself. To run the test suite, just view `SpecRunner.html` in your browser. I suggest using live server so that your tests rerun when you save you file.

**Important:** The test cases specify the name of the required methods, arguments, etc. So **read each test case carefully.** Test cases are located in the spec folder.

# Exercises
All functions should be defined in main.js located in the src folder. **This is the only file you should edit.**

Task 1:

Write a function that, given a total number of years of study, returns the user's level of experience:

// From 0-1 year: Beginner
// From 1-3 years: Intermediate
// From 3-6 years: Advanced
// 7 years and above: Master

Task 2:

Write a function that checks whether the passed skills array contains the skill "Javascript" and returns a boolean true/false indicating its presence or absence.
